description: >
  This command creates tag tuples from the given set of tag vectors and stores it in an environment variable.
  Moreover, referenced semantic versions are split and considered as separate elements.
  For instance, `docker:{DOCKER_VERSION}` with `DOCKER_VERSION` equalling to `18.09.0` resolves to
  `docker, docker18, docker18.09, docker18.09.0`.

steps:
  - envorb/cmd:
      variable: DOCKER_TAGS
      cmd: echo "<< parameters.tags >>" | tuplip exec
